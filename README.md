Below you can find Training/Testing Code for our anomaly Detection project which was published in Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, CVPR 2018.

The implementation is tested using:

Keras version 1.1.0

Theano 1.0.2

Python 3

Ubuntu 16.04


We used C3D-v1.0 (https://github.com/facebook/C3D) with default settings as a feature extractor.
